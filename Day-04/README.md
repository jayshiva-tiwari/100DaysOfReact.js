# Props & Reusable Components

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:


## What Are Props?

Props are inputs to React components ‚Äî short for properties ‚Äî that allow data to flow from parent components to child components. Props are a one-way data flow mechanism, meaning they are read-only in the child.


```ts

function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}

function App() {
  return <Welcome name="Jay" />;
}

```

- Here, name is passed as a prop from App to Welcome.
- Inside the Welcome component, it‚Äôs accessed as props.name.


```js
function Welcome({ name }) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}
```
