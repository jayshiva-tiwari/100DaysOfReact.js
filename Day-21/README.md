# Day 21

## What You’ve Learned So Far
- JSX and Rendering

   - Writing JSX, embedding expressions,conditional and list rendering.

- Component Types

   - Functional components (w/ props and state), class vs functional patterns.

- Props

  - Data flow from parent to child, props destructuring, default props.

- State (local)

  - useState (numbers, strings, objects, arrays), state immutability.

- Component Hierarchy

  - Lifting state up, prop drilling, structuring for reusability.

- Events & Handlers

  - Responding to user actions (click, input, change).

- Controlled Components

  - Forms, input handling, validation.

- Conditional Rendering

  - Ternary, &&, if/else in rendering.

- Fragments

  - Removing unnecessary <div>, using <> and <React.Fragment>.

- Lists & Keys

  - Mapping arrays, unique key usage, adding/removing/editing items.

- Styling

  - Inline, external CSS, CSS Modules, media queries for responsive UI.

- Component Refactoring

  - Single responsibility, composability, folder structure.

- Filtering & Searching

  - Controlled inputs, dynamic list filtering based on input/state.

##### 📝 Mini Self-Check Questions
- Quickly answer these to gauge your readiness for the milestone project:

  - What is the difference between a controlled and uncontrolled input in React?

  - How do you “lift state up” and why might you need to?

  - Why are keys important when rendering a list, and what kind of value should you use?

  - Show how to pass and destructure props in a functional component using TypeScript.

  - What are media queries and why are they important for UI development?

  - How would you conditionally render a warning message if a list is empty?

  - Describe when and how to use a Fragment.

  - What’s the best practice for updating an array in React state?

  - How do you structure a folder for scalable React apps?

  - Give an example of how to filter an array of objects based on a text input in React.

  - Write your answers in your notes or discuss them with a mentor. For any question you’re unsure of, revisit that day’s code and explanations!

##### ✅ Quick Practice Exercise
- Build a Single-File App:

  - Create a basic contact list with useState.

  - Add, edit, and remove contacts.

  - Responsive UI with the list on the left and a details pane on the right (becomes stacked on mobile).

  - Use Props, State, Conditional Rendering, Lists, and Fragments.
